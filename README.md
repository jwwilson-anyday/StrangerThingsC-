Welcome to Stranger Things the Game!  You will be making a .NET console app that will let the player adventure through Hawkins, Indiana and defeat the big bad guy, the Demi-Gorgon at the end!
- Choose your character and set off across the rural town.
- Each location in Hawkins needs an item to "unlock"
- Collect items to unlock more locations.
- Move to the Upside Down and back in order to see more potential locations and items.
- Move to the final location where the Demi-Gorgon lives with the right item to defeat it and WIN.
- Each round played in the Upside Down will subtract 5% of life from your player.
- Once the player reaches 0% health, the game is over and you LOSE.
